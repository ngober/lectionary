prayer: |
  Oh Lord, help us to approach you with becoming conception of your nature.
  You live in the highest heaven and this cannot contain you. We live in a house of clay.
  Your understanding is infinite. We know nothing as we ought to know.

  Sustain us under our trials, give us grace to rest in you and assure us of deliverance.
  Grant that we may never trust in our hearts, but be strong in the grace of Jesus, that we may know how to obtain relief from a guilty conscience without feeling reconciled to our imperfections.
  May we always combine your majesty with your mercy, and shall our hearts always rejoice in your praises.
