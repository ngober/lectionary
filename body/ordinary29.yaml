    \textit{We thank you, Lord.}

    For our daily food and drink, our homes and families, and our friends, \\
    \textit{We thank you, Lord.}

    For minds to think, and hearts to love, and hands to serve, \\
    \textit{We thank you, Lord.}

    For health and strength to work, and leisure to rest and play, \\
    \textit{We thank you, Lord.}

    For the brave and courageous, who are patient in suffering and faithful in adversity, \\
    \textit{We thank you, Lord.}

    For all valiant seekers after truth, liberty, and justice, \\

    \textbf{Any who are gathered may share a thing they are thankful for. After each, all say:} \\
    \textit{We thank you, Lord.}

    For the communion of saints, in all times and places, \\
