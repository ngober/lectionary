prayer: |
  Almighty God, you have given your only-begotten Son to take our nature upon him, and to be born of a pure virgin: Grant that we, who have been born again and made your children by adoption and grace, may be renewed by your Holy Spirit; through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with you and the same spirit be honor and glory, now and forever,
