prayer: >
  O God our rock,
  We thank you that you did not leave us rudderless and tossed by storms in this life,
  but have graciously given us, in your word and in the witness of the Holy Spirit,
  a true mooring for our own lives,
  a true anchor for our souls.
  We pray that you would daily increase our deep hunger for your word and your truth
  that our own words and choices and actions would be shaped by your gracious revelation,
