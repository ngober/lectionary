prayer: 
  text: |
    God of glory,
    you have given us a new name and robed us in salvation.
    May we like Anna find our home in your presence,
    and like Simeon recognize Jesus as the Christ,
    so that, in joy and thanksgiving at becoming your children,
    we may join with all creation to sing your praise.
