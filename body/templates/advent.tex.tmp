\subsubsection*{Recite the following together: The Apostles' Creed}

I believe in God, the Father almighty,\\
creator of heaven and earth.

\vspace{12pt}
\noindent
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,\\
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit\\
and born of the virgin Mary.\\
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,\\
was crucified, died, and was buried;\\
he descended to the dead.\\
The third day he rose again from the dead.\\
He ascended to heaven\\
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.\\
From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

\vspace{12pt}
\noindent
I believe in the Holy Spirit,\\
the holy Christian church,\\
the communion of saints,\\
the forgiveness of sins,\\
the resurrection of the body,\\
and the life everlasting. Amen.
