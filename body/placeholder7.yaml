prayer:
  text: >
    Holy Spirit, we are thankful for the church you have given us of which we may be a part.
    Open our eyes, our ears, and our hearts, that we may grow closer to you through joy and through suffering.
    Be with us in the fullness of your power as new members are added to your household, as we grow in grace through the years, when we are joined in marriage, when we turn to you in sickness or special need, and, at the last, when we are committed into the Father's hands.
