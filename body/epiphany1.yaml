prayer:
  text: >
    God of grace and glory,
    you call us with your voice of flame
    to be your people, faithful and courageous.
    As your beloved Son
    embraced his mission in the waters of baptism,
    inspire us with the fire of your Spirit
    to join in his transforming work.
    We ask this in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ,
    who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
