prayer: |
  Oh God, author of all grace and comfort, come work repentence in our souls;
  Present sin to us in its odious colors that we may hate it;
  Melt our hearts by your majesty and mercy.

  Teach us to behold our Creator, his arms outstretched.
  Make us willing to be saved in his way, perceiving nothing in ourselves.
  Help us not only to receive him but to be conformed to him, imperfect but still pressing forward.
  Give us that faith which is the means of salvation, and the principle and medium of all godliness.

  In Jesus Christ our Lord,
