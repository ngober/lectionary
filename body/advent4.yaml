prayer: |
  Father God, what should we render to you for the gift of gifts, your own dear Son, our Redeemer?
  Take us in spirit to the watchful shepherds.
  Let us hear good tidings of great joy; and hearing: believe, rejoice, praise, adore, our conscience bathed in an ocean of repose, eyes uplifted to a reconciled Father.
  Place us among the animals to look with them upon the Redeemer's face and in him account our deliverance from sin.
  Herein is the wonder of wonders, come below to raise us above: Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever,
