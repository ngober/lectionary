prayer: >
  When joy is gone and hearts are sick, O God,
  you give us Christ as our healing balm.
  He came in human flesh
  that he might give himself as a ransom for our salvation
  and anoint us with the Spirit of consolation and joy.
  Hear the cry of your people,
  that we may rejoice in the richness of your love
  and be faithful stewards of your many gifts.
