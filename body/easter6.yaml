  Almighty God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ is the light of the world,
  grant that your people may shine with the radiance of Christ's Glory,
  that he may be known, worshiped, and obeyed to the ends of the earth.
  Through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God now and forever,
