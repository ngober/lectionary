prayer:
  text: >
    Almighty God, whom truly to know is everlasting life,
    Grant us perfectly to know your Son Jesus Christ to be the way, the truth, and the life,
    that we may steadfastly follow his steps in the way that leads to eternal life.
    Grant us assurance by our baptism that you will save us as you saved Noah,
    and that we may have peace in the promise that you will make all things new.
