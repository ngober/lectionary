prayer:
  text: |
    Our lives are so small, O Lord; our courage so frail.
    Therefore give us grace and guidance for the journey ahead.
    You alone, O God, by your gracious and life-giving Spirit
    have power to knit our imperfect hearts.

    Unite your people and multiply our meager offerings, O Lord,
    that all might resound to your glory.
    Let all that we do here in these our brief lives,
    in this our brief moment to love, in this work that you have ordained for this community,
    flower in winsome and beautiful foretaste of greater glories yet to come.

    O Spirit of God, now shape our hearts. \\
    O Spirit of God, now guide our hands. \\
    O Spirit of God, now build your kingdom among us.
