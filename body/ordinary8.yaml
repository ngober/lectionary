  text: |
    God, you call us to go where Christ leads.
    Turn us from the ways of the world;
    guide us to fullness of joy in the Spirit,
    where bodies and souls rest secure;
    and grant us strength
    to follow the way of the cross,
    which frees us to love one another
    for the sake of all creation.
