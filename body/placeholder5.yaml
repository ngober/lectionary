prayer:
  text: >
    Almighty and everliving God, we thank you that you give us the most precious body and blood of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ; and you assure us of your favor and goodness towards us; and that we are very members incorporated in the mystical body of your Son, the blessed company of all faithful people; and are also heirs through hope of your everlasting kingdom.
    And we ask you, O heavenly Father, to assist our church and our family with your grace that we may continue in holy fellowship, as often as we take this, and do all such good works as you have prepared for us to walk in; though Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, be all honor and glory, world without end.
