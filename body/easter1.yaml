    Mighty God,
    in whom we know the power of redemption,
    you stand among us in the shadows of our time.
    As we move through every sorrow and trial of this life,
    uphold us with knowledge of the final morning
    when, in the glorious presence of your risen Son,
    we will share in his resurrection,
    redeemed and restored to the fullness of life
    and forever freed to be your people.
