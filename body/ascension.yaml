prayer: |
  Oh God, the King of Glory, you have exalted your only Son Jesus Christ with great triumph to your kingdom in heaven.
  Do not leave us comfortless, but send us your Holy Spirit to strengthen us, and exalt us to that place where our Savior Christ has gone before, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, One God, in glory everlasting,
