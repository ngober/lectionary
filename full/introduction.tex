\section{The Seasons of the Year}

The Christian calendar is divided into seasons that follow the life of Jesus Christ.
We follow the calendar and the seasons to order our life to remember what our Lord has done for us.
The seasons follow the pattern of fasting and feasting, with each feast preceded by a fast.
In a fast, we prepare our hearts for the joy of the feast to come.

\begin{itemize}
\item The Fast of Advent
\item The Feast of Christmas
\item The Fast of Lent
\item The Feast of Easter
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Advent}

Advent is the season of lights, and is celebrated over the four Sundays before Christmas Day, beginning either in the last week of November or the first week of December.
It celebrates the coming of the Lord Jesus, the light that has come into the world.
Advent is marked by the lighting of candles.
Each week on Sunday, a new candle is lit; during the week, the week's candles are lit whenever the family gathers to eat at the table.

\subsection*{Christmas}

The season of Christmas begins on Christmas Day and lasts 12 days, ending with Epiphany.
The season is marked by the giving of gifts.

\subsection*{Lent}

The season of Lent is the primary fast of the year, beginning on Ash Wednesday and lasting for 40 days, excluding Sundays, to end with Easter Sunday.
The season is marked by self-denial: it is fitting during this time to give up during this season something to which one is entitled.

\subsection*{Easter}

The season of Easter begins on Easter Sunday and ends with Pentecost.
The season celebrates the resurrection of Jesus and anticipates the giving of the Holy Spirit.
