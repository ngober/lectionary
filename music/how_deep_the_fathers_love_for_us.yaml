    lyrics:
      - How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure;
        That he should give his only Son to make a wretch his treasure.
        How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turns his face away
        as wounds that mar the Chosen One bring many sons to glory.

      - Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders;
        Ashamed I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers.
        It was my sin that held him there until it was ac -- com -- \skip1 plished.
        His dying breath has brought me life; I know that it is finished.

      - I will not boast in anything; no gifts, no pow'r no wisdom;
        But I will boast in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection.
        Why should I gain from his reward? I cannot give an answer.
        But this I know with all my heart: his wounds have paid my ransom.
