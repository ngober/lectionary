    lyrics:
      - |
        When peace like a river attendeth my way,
        When sorrows like sea billows roll;
        Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
        "It is well. It is well with my soul"

      - |
        Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
        Let this blest assurance control,
        That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
        And has shed his own blood for my soul.

      - |
        My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought,
        My sin, not in part but the whole
        Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more,
        Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Oh my soul!

      - |
        And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
        The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
        The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,
        "Even so," It is well with my soul.
