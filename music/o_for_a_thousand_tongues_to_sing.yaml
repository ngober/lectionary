    lyrics:
      - |
        O for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise,
        the glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace!

      - |
        My gracious Master and my God, assist me to proclaim,
        to spread through all the earth abroad the honors of your name.

      - |
        Jesus! the name that charms our fears, that bids our sorrows cease,
        'tis music in the sinner's ears, 'tis life and health and peace.

      - |
        He breaks the pow'r of cancelled sin, he sets the pris'ner free;
        his blood can make the foulest clean; his blood availed for me.

      - |
        To God all glory, praise, and love be now and ever giv'n
        by saints below and saints above, the Church in earth and heav'n.
