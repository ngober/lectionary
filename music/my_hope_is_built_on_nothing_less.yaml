    lyrics:
      - >
        My hope is built on nothing less
        than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
        I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
        but wholly lean on Jesus' name.

      - >
        When darkness veils his lovely face,
        I rest on his unchanging grace;
        in every high and stormy gale,
        my anchor holds within the veil.

      - >
        His oath, his covenant, his blood,
        support me in the whelming flood;
        when all around my soul gives way,
        he then is all my hope and stay.

      - >
        When he shall come with trumpet sound,
        O may I then in him be found:
        dressed in his righteousness alone,
        faultless to stand before the throne.

    lyrics:

        On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand:
        all other ground is sinking sand;
        all other ground is sinking sand.
