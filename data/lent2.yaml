  O Lord,

  Show us those sins obscure you and eclipse your love.
  Help us to humble ourselves for past evils, to be resolved to walk with more care.
  For if we do not walk in holiness before you, how can we be assured of our salvation?

  Indeed, it is the meek and humble who are shown your covenant, know your will, are pardoned and healed;
  who by faith depend and rest upon grace, who are sanctified and renewed, who evidence your love.
  Help us to pray in faith and so find your will, by leaning hard on your rich, free mercy,
  by believing you will give what you have promised;

  Strengthen us to pray with the conviction that whatever we recieve is your gift, so that we may pray until prayer be granted;
  Teach us to believe that all degrees of mercy arise from several degrees of prayer,
  that when faith is begin it is imperfect and must grow,
  as chapped ground opens wider and wider until rain comes.

  So we wait for your your will and pray for it to be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven in the name of Christ Jesus our Lord,
