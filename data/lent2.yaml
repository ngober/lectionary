      After these things the word of the \textsc{Lord} came to Abram in a vision: ``Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.''

      But Abram said, ``O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?''

      And Abram said, ``Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.''

      And behold, the word of the \textsc{Lord} came to him: ``This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.''

      And he brought him outside and said, ``Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them." Then he said to him, ``So shall your offspring be.''

      And he believed the \textsc{Lord}, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

      And he said to him, ``I am the \textsc{Lord} who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.''

      But he said, ``O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?''

      The \textsc{Lord} is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The \textsc{Lord} is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

      When evildoers assail me to eat up my flesh, my adversaries and foes, it is they who stumble and fall.

      Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, yet I will be confident.

      One thing have I asked of the \textsc{Lord}, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the \textsc{Lord} all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the \textsc{Lord} and to inquire in his temple.

      For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock.

      And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the \textsc{Lord}.

      Hear, O \textsc{Lord}, when I cry aloud; be gracious to me and answer me!

      You have said, ``Seek my face." My heart says to you, ``Your face, \textsc{Lord}, do I seek.''

      Hide not your face from me. Turn not your servant away in anger, O you who have been my help. Cast me not off; forsake me not, O God of my salvation!

      For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the \textsc{Lord} will take me in.

      Teach me your way, O \textsc{Lord}, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.

      Give me not up to the will of my adversaries; for false witnesses have risen against me, and they breathe out violence.

      I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the \textsc{Lord} in the land of the living!

      Wait for the \textsc{Lord}; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the \textsc{Lord}!

      And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again.

      And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.

      But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, ``Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.''

      And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, ``If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.

      For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it.

      For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?

      For what can a man give in return for his soul?

      For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.''

      What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?

      For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.

      For what does the Scripture say? ``Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.''

      Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.

      And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,

      For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.

      For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.

      For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.

      That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring--not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,

      as it is written, ``I have made you the father of many nations''--in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.

  O Lord,

  Show us those sins obscure you and eclipse your love.
  Help us to humble ourselves for past evils, to be resolved to walk with more care.
  For if we do not walk in holiness before you, how can we be assured of our salvation?

  Indeed, it is the meek and humble who are shown your covenant, know your will, are pardoned and healed;
  who by faith depend and rest upon grace, who are sanctified and renewed, who evidence your love.
  Help us to pray in faith and so find your will, by leaning hard on your rich, free mercy,
  by believing you will give what you have promised;

  Strengthen us to pray with the conviction that whatever we recieve is your gift, so that we may pray until prayer be granted;
  Teach us to believe that all degrees of mercy arise from several degrees of prayer,
  that when faith is begin it is imperfect and must grow,
  as chapped ground opens wider and wider until rain comes.

  So we wait for your your will and pray for it to be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven in the name of Christ Jesus our Lord,
