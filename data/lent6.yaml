prayer: |
  Oh Lord, our thoughts of you have been too small, too few--for seldom have we considered how specific is the exercising of your authority, extending as it does into the myriad particulars of creation.
  There is no quarter over which you are not king.
  You are the God of Justice, the God of Wisdom, the God of Mercy, the God of Redemption.
  You are the Lord of Love.

  All of this is true. But our thoughts of you are still too few, for our minds are too small to conceive of them all, let alone to contain them.
  You were before all things, you created all things, and in you all things are held together. There is no corner of creation you will fail to redeem.

  You are the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. Oh Jesus Christ, our King of Everything,
