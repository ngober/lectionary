      The \textsc{Lord} spoke to Moses, saying,

      ``Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the people of Israel: you shall say to them,

      The \textsc{Lord} bless you and keep you;\\
      the \textsc{Lord} make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;\\
      the \textsc{Lord} lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.\\

      ``So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.''

      Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,

      who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
      but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.
      And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
      Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,
      so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
      and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

      And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
      And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
      (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, ``Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord'')
      and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, ``a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.''

      Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
      And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
      And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law,
      he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,

      ``Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word;

      for my eyes have seen your salvation

      that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,

      a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.''

      And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.

      And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, ``Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed
      (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.''

      And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin,
      and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.
      And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.
