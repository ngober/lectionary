        ``In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered.
        This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
        And all went to be registered, each to his own town.
        And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,
        to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.

        And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth.
        And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

        And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
        And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear.
        And the angel said to them, ``Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
        For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
        And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.''

        And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
        ``Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!''

        When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ``Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.''
        And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.
        And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child.
        And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them.
        But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart.
        And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.''

        ``For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

        Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the \textsc{Lord} of hosts will do this.''

        ``Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,
        but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.
        He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,''

  prayer: |
    Father God, what should we render to you for the gift of gifts, your own dear Son, our Redeemer?
    Take us in spirit to the watchful shepherds.
    Let us hear good tidings of great joy; and hearing: believe, rejoice, praise, adore, our conscience bathed in an ocean of repose, eyes uplifted to a reconciled Father.
    Place us among the animals to look with them upon the Redeemer's face and in him account our deliverance from sin.
    Herein is the wonder of wonders, come below to raise us above: Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever,
